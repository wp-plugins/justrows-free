JustRows is a Wordpress plugin that allows to display a gallery of featured images in a grid similar to Google Images.

== Description ==
JustRows takes the featured images of posts from a given post type, and shows them as a responsive image grid.
The generated galleries may be customized using one of many user-created configurations.

* images are placed in order (by date or other fields)
* all images are resized via javascript so that each row is composed of thumbnails of the same height, also all rows except the last one are justified
* new images can be appended, either with a button or infinite scrolling (depending on the settings)
* users can define multiple configurations
* users can place a gallery through a widget or a shortcode
